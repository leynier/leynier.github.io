# Hi World! 👋 I'm Leynier Gutiérrez González 👨🏻‍💻

<codersrank-summary username="leynier"></codersrank-summary>

I'm a student of Computer Science. I know several programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Dart, Java, Python and Javascript; in addition to other markup or style languages such as HTML, CSS and JSON. I really like both mobile application development and web application development, using frameworks, software, technologies, etc like Android Studio, Flutter, Unity, Flask, Vue.js and Bootstrap.

In my free time I'm always researching and learning about new technologies, frameworks, etc. I'm good working both individually and as a team, I know the development methodologies of agile software and tools like Git.
